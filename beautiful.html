    <h3 align="center">NATURE</h3>
    <q align="center">Nature is not a place to visit, it is home</q>
    <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena</p>

    <h3 id="water" align="center">WATER</h3>
    <p>Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen H<sub>2</sub> and oxygen O<sub>2</sub> H<sub>2</sub>O and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a <abbr title="Solid Substance">SS</abbr>, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.<br> On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.</p>
<p>some common elements in water are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>chlorine</li>
    <li>bromine</li>
    <li>arsenic</li>
</ul> 
<h3>types of water contaminats</h3>
<dt>LEAD</dt>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead" target="_blank">Lead</a> is a toxic metal that can cause damage to health even at low doses. Corrosion of household plumbing systems and erosion of natural deposits are major sources of lead pollution in public drinking water. The amount of lead found in the water varies depending on how long the water is exposed to the pipes, the amount of corrosion on the pipes, the water’s acidity and the temperature of the water. Lead in drinking water can cause a variety of adverse health effects.</dd>  
  <dt>CHLORINE</dt>
  <dd>Chlorine is a powerful oxidant added to the water by several municipal water systems to control microbes. Chlorine can be absorbed through physical consumption as well as through your skin while bathing. Chlorine can severely dry skin and hair and cause irritating effects to your eyes and nose.</dd>
  <dt>VOCS</dt>
  <dd><a href="https://waterfilterguru.com/what-are-vocs-in-water/" target="_blank">Volatile Organic Compounds</a>include a variety of chemicals emitted as gases. Thousands of products contain VOC’s so it’s no surprise some of these elements end up in our drinking water. When water is heated and vaporized, your body can absorb these contaminants.</dd>

<h3 align="center" id="food">FOOD</h3>
<p>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal" target="_blank">animal</a>, or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.</p>
<br>

<h3>definition and classification</h3>
<p>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism.[2][3] It can be raw, processed, or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth, health, or pleasure. Food is mainly composed of water, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Minerals (e.g., salts) and organic substances (e.g., vitamins) can also be found in food.[4] Plants, algae, and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make some of their own nutrients.[5] Water is found in many foods and has been defined as a food by itself.[6] Water and fiber have low energy densities, or calories, while fat is the most energy-dense component.[3] Some inorganic (non-food) elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning.[7]</p>
<p><img src="web.jpg" title="food chain">Human food can be classified in various ways, either by related content or by how it is processed.[8] The number and composition of food groups can vary. Most systems include four basic groups that describe their origin and relative nutritional function: Vegetables and Fruit, Cereals and Bread, Dairy, and Meat.[9] Studies that look into diet quality group food into whole grains/cereals, refined grains/cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, eggs, dairy products, fish, red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages.[10][11][12] The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization use a system with nineteen food classifications: cereals, roots, pulses and nuts, milk, eggs, fish and shellfish, meat, insects, vegetables, fruits, fats and oils, sweets and sugars, spices and condiments, beverages, foods for nutritional uses, food additives, composite dishes and savoury snacks.[13]</p>
